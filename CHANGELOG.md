# @sv443-network/userutils

## 8.0.1

### Patch Changes

- a92000b: Added `exports` to package.json and corrected `module` property

## 8.0.0

### Major Changes

- 54ee0ce: Changed `hexToRgb()` and `rgbToHex()` to support `#RGBA` and `#RRGGBBAA` color codes (with an alpha channel).
  Both functions now have an `alpha` value immediately after `blue`, which can be set to `undefined` to restore the old behavior.

### Minor Changes

- 54ee0ce: Added parameter `upperCase` (false by default) to `lightenColor()` and `darkenColor()`

### Patch Changes

- 54ee0ce: Consolidated behavior of `lightenColor()` and `darkenColor()` when using non-number values

## 7.0.1

### Patch Changes

- d8f6852: Fix package.json exports

## 7.0.0

### Major Changes

- fadebf0: Removed the function `insertAfter()` because the DOM API already has the method [`insertAdjacentElement()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentElement) that has the same functionality and even four positions to pick from.
  To get the same behavior as `insertAfter(refElem, newElem)`, you can use `refElem.insertAdjacentElement("afterend", newElem)`

### Minor Changes

- ca6ff58: Added option `checkInterval` to SelectorObserver to check on interval instead of on mutation
- 1e2015c: Added `DataStoreSerializer` class for centralized and much easier and safer de-/serialization of any number of DataStore instances

- 948ac89: DataStore: made `runMigrations`, `encodeData` and `decodeData` public and added `encodingEnabled` method
- d7cdac0: Made `randomId()` default to using Math.random() and added the parameter `enhancedEntropy` to revert back to the much slower but also much more entropic implementation
- 287b006: Added ability to change DataStore storage engine from default "GM" to "localStorage" and "sessionStorage"

## 6.3.0

### Minor Changes

- fa09004: Made `openInNewTab()` use `GM.openInTab` by default and fall back to the old behavior.
  Also added `background` param to specify if the tab should get focus when opened.

## 6.2.0

- 0173235: Add property to change the debounce edge in `SelectorObserver` instances

## 6.1.0

  - `deleteConfig()` is now called `deleteData()`
  - the internal GM storage keys will still have the prefix `_uucfg` for backwards compatibility

### Patch Changes

- 2ae665d: fixed wrong TS type for SelectorObserver options in constructor

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 1859022: `onSelector()` has been turned into the `SelectorObserver` class to reduce the performance impact on larger sites:

  - its instances can be scoped to any element lower in the DOM tree, unlike before where it was always observing the entire body with all its children
  - separate instances can be disabled and reenabled individually on demand
  - separate instances can have different MutationObserver options set to further reduce performance impact
  - the separation into instances allows for a new "chaining" paradigm where selector listeners are only added and checked for once they are actually needed (see examples in the documentation)
  - when using chaining, separate instances can be created and have listeners added to them before their base element is available in the DOM tree
  - every listener can have a set debounce time, so that it doesn't get called too often (works the same as the [`debounce()` function](https://github.com/Sv443-Network/UserUtils/blob/main/README.md#debounce), but is disabled by default)
  - there are now multiple methods to get and delete specific listeners

  The `SelectorObserver.addListener()` method is backwards compatible with the old `onSelector()` function, so you can just add the class instance in front (for full backwards compat use `document.body` for the `baseElement` parameter of the constructor), then change the old function's name and it should work as before.
  For more info and examples, please view the [SelectorObserver documentation](https://github.com/Sv443-Network/UserUtils/blob/main/README.md#selectorobserver)

### Minor Changes

- 0db73b5: Removed the limiter (DynamicsCompressorNode) from `amplifyMedia()` for clear and undistorted audio.

  **Notable changes:**

  - The property `source` has been renamed to `sourceNode` to fit the naming of the `gainNode` property
  - A boolean property `enabled` has been added to check if the amplification is enabled or not
  - The parameter `initialMultiplier` has been renamed to `initialGain` to reduce confusion (it is not a multiplier strictly speaking)

- 736784f: Added function `randomId()` to randomly generate cryptographically strong hexadecimal IDs
- 563e515: Added utility type `NonEmptyArray` for typing an array with at least 1 item

  - Added properties: `enable()`, `disable()`, `setLimiterOptions()` and `limiterNode`
  - Other changes: Amplification is no longer enabled automatically, `enable()` must now be called manually after initializing
