## 9.0.0

### Major Changes

- 9abfc6b: **BREAKING** - Reworked translation system:
  - Removed `tr()`, `tr.setLanguage()` and `tr.getLanguage()`
  - Renamed function `tr.addLanguage()` to `tr.addTranslations()`
  - Removed `%n`-based argument insertion by default (re-enable explicitly with `tr.addTransform(tr.transforms.percent)`).
  - Added ability for nested translation objects and object traversal via dot notation.
  - Added functions:
    - `tr.for()` - translates a key for the specified language.
    - `tr.use()` - creates a translation function for the specified language for much easier usage.
    - `tr.hasKey()` - checks if a key exists in the given language.
    - `tr.setFallbackLanguage()` - sets the fallback language used when a key is not found in the given language.
    - `tr.getFallbackLanguage()` - returns the fallback language.
    - `tr.addTransform()` - adds a transform function to the translation system, allowing for custom argument insertion and much more.
    - `tr.deleteTransform()` - removes a transform function.
  - Added ability to specify transform patterns and functions for arbitrary modification of the translation string.
    - Added transform for template literal syntax (e.g. `${keyName}`) with `tr.addTransform(tr.transforms.templateLiteral)`. This transform supports positional argument injection, as well as named arguments via an object with the same keys as in the template literal pattern. See the documentation for more information and a code example.
  - Added TS type `TrKeys<T>` for extracting the keys of a translation object (both flat and nested).
  - Fixed bug with resolving translations for flat objects.
- d0737dc: **BREAKING** - Reworked debounce system:
  - Edge types `rising` and `falling` have been removed.
  - Added new edge types `immediate` and `idle` with new behavior.
    - `immediate` (default & recommended) will trigger immediately, then queue all subsequent calls until the timeout has passed.
    - `idle` will trigger the last queued call only after there haven't been any subsequent calls for the specified timeout.
  - Added `Debouncer` class for more advanced control over debouncing, and with that the following changes:
    - Ability to attach and manage multiple listeners.
    - Inherits from NanoEmitter, allowing event-based debouncing.
    - Can be inherited by your own classes for built-in debouncing.
  - `debounce()` function can still be called as usual (after replacing the edge type names with the new ones). Internally, it will instantiate a `Debouncer` instance, which is available via the `debouncer` property on the returned function.
  - Reduced default timeout from 300ms to 200ms.

### Minor Changes

- cd241b0: Added `additionalProps` parameter to `openInNewTab()` to add or overwrite anchor element props (only if `GM.openInTab()` is unavailable)
- d0737dc: Moved documentation to separate file `docs.md` to speed up `README.md` load time.

### Major Changes

- 54ee0ce: Changed `hexToRgb()` and `rgbToHex()` to support `#RGBA` and `#RRGGBBAA` color codes (with an alpha channel).
  Both functions now have an `alpha` value immediately after `blue`, which can be set to `undefined` to restore the old behavior.

### Minor Changes

- 54ee0ce: Added parameter `upperCase` (false by default) to `lightenColor()` and `darkenColor()`

- fadebf0: Removed the function `insertAfter()` because the DOM API already has the method [`insertAdjacentElement()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentElement) that has the same functionality and even four positions to pick from.
  To get the same behavior as `insertAfter(refElem, newElem)`, you can use `refElem.insertAdjacentElement("afterend", newElem)`

### Minor Changes

## 6.3.0

## 6.1.0

  - the internal GM storage keys will still have the prefix `_uucfg` for backwards compatibility

## 4.2.1

### Patch Changes

### Patch Changes

- 2ae665d: fixed wrong TS type for SelectorObserver options in constructor

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 1859022: `onSelector()` has been turned into the `SelectorObserver` class to reduce the performance impact on larger sites:

  - its instances can be scoped to any element lower in the DOM tree, unlike before where it was always observing the entire body with all its children
  - separate instances can be disabled and reenabled individually on demand
  - separate instances can have different MutationObserver options set to further reduce performance impact
  - the separation into instances allows for a new "chaining" paradigm where selector listeners are only added and checked for once they are actually needed (see examples in the documentation)
  - when using chaining, separate instances can be created and have listeners added to them before their base element is available in the DOM tree
  - every listener can have a set debounce time, so that it doesn't get called too often (works the same as the [`debounce()` function](https://github.com/Sv443-Network/UserUtils/blob/v3.0.0/README.md#debounce), but is disabled by default)
  - there are now multiple methods to get and delete specific listeners

  The `SelectorObserver.addListener()` method is backwards compatible with the old `onSelector()` function, so you can just add the class instance in front (for full backwards compat use `document.body` for the `baseElement` parameter of the constructor), then change the old function's name and it should work as before.
  For more info and examples, please view the [SelectorObserver documentation](https://github.com/Sv443-Network/UserUtils/blob/v3.0.0/README.md#selectorobserver)

### Minor Changes

- 0db73b5: Removed the limiter (DynamicsCompressorNode) from `amplifyMedia()` for clear and undistorted audio.

  **Notable changes:**

  - The property `source` has been renamed to `sourceNode` to fit the naming of the `gainNode` property
  - A boolean property `enabled` has been added to check if the amplification is enabled or not
  - The parameter `initialMultiplier` has been renamed to `initialGain` to reduce confusion (it is not a multiplier strictly speaking)

- 736784f: Added function `randomId()` to randomly generate cryptographically strong hexadecimal IDs
- 563e515: Added utility type `NonEmptyArray` for typing an array with at least 1 item
